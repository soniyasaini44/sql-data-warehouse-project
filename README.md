** Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀
This project showcases my skills in building a modern data warehouse from scratch and generating actionable business insights using SQL. It is designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate my capabilities as a **fresher data analyst** with a strong focus on **ETL, data modeling, and analytics**.

---

##  Data Architecture: Medallion Design

The project is structured using the **Medallion Architecture**, implementing three core layers — **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** — for data processing and analytics:

1. **Bronze Layer** – Raw data directly ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
2. **Silver Layer** – Data is cleaned, transformed, and standardized to resolve quality issues.
3. **Gold Layer** – Business-ready, analytics-optimized data modeled using a **Star Schema** for efficient querying and reporting.
